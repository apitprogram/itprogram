**What we will learn today?**

* What is a computer program?


## What is a computer program

> Intro to programming logic – Making a sandwich (Source:

1. Ask the students what they think a program is at its most basic level
   * Guide, if necessary, towards the idea that its instructions or an action
     etc.
2. Focus on the idea of instructions:
   * Explain that like with a physical activity - tools and steps are required
     to carry out instructions
   * Introduce the group activity of programming the activity of making a
     sandwich
3. Ask the students what items we will need to make a sandwich:
   * As they shout them out list them on the screen for the whole class to see
   * Introduce the concept of objects and classes. Tie into the idea of how in a
     program these would be the 'tools' required for an activity and how for our
     sandwich making task the items we have listed previously are our classes
4. Now that we have all of the tools we need to make a sandwich ask the students
   to shout out what they think the first step or instruction is:
   * Write the instruction out on the screen and ask the students which object
     would be needed to carry out that instruction
   * Copy the instruction and place it under the object that the students have
     decided is responsible for it and introduce the idea of methods
   * Continue asking the students for instructions and listing them under the
     objects that would be responsible for them (in the case where two objects
     are required to carry out an instruction try and break it down further with
     the students until only one object is responsible for any one instruction –
     could be a good way to introduce the idea of how specific you need to be in
     programming and the concepts that are detailed in the source example of
     this exercise)
5. Once the students are satisfied with the instructions take the best formed
   class and ask the students to come up with a one word summary for each
   instruction that is has. Explain the benefits of well named methods in
   programming and (maybe?) touch on naming conventions.
